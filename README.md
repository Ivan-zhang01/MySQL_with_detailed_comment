# MySQL_with_detailed_comment
This project aims to provide a detaied explaination on every function of MySQL's source code. 
It can both view using:

- C/C++ IDE 
- Web brower acting like a Blog 

## How to Use This Project

We try to give every function a detailed explaination like: what's its main fucntionality, where/when it'll be invoked, cross referencing any other functions. All these information lies right before the implementation code as comment along with the default comment add by MySQL community developer. However the extra comment is not a plain text comment, it has its own syntac in order to be able to translate into markdown format and fancy web pages. Find more about the transform tool, see: [mysql_source_code_explaination](https://github.com/cenalulu/mysql_source_code_explaination)


## How to Do My Own Source Code Reading

It's really easy! You can start up right now by just cloning this repositry using: 

``` shell
git clont https://github.com/cenalulu/MySQL_with_detailed_comment.git
